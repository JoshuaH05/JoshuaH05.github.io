### CPSC 120 Favorite Labs

* Lab 7, Part 2

    This lab was one of my favorites because implementing all the different functions for each street was interesting. I had to use many if statements and operators and getting to get creative with them was fun. It took a while to make all of the functions work, but learning about if statements and using operators made it worth it.

* Lab 6, Part 1

    This was also a fun lab because I got to learn how to use different arguments and make them strings. When the lab was done I was able to get creative with the different words used in the sandwich maker Mad Lib. The lab was also interesting because it was my first time validating the number of arguments provided, which is something we do in almost every lab now.

* Lab 4, Part 1

    I enjoyed this lab because it was my first time having to work with two files. I found the functions file in this lab the most fun because it was interesting making all the different conversions. I also had to call other functions a lot and use different arguments which made me much more comfortable in calling functions.
